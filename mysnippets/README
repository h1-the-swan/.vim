These are user defined snippets for UltiSnips.
The following lines in the vimrc worked to get UltiSnips to look here for snippets:
```
let g:UltiSnipsSnippetDirectories=['mysnippets', 'UltiSnips']
let g:UltiSnipsSnippetsDir=expand("$HOME/.vim/mysnippets/")
```

These snippets have priority over default snippets in .vim/bundle/vim-snippets
